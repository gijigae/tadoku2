The Japan Sumo Association is in trouble regarding baseball gambling. It is said that some sumo wrestlers and a stable master have bet illegally on baseball games. I guess that gambling has been going on for a long time as a practice among some sumo wrestlers. An Ozeki sumo wrestler in particular was reportedly threatened by a gangster. The gangster demanded hush money of the wrestler regarding his betting on baseball games. Baseball gambling is conducted by gangsters. Therefore, the profits from this business fund illegal activities. To participate in gambling helps such antisocial groups. There are many other problems in the Sumo Association which are being revealed these days. I hope that it will regain its good form.
