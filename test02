I guess that the gambles have been doing for a long time as a practice among some sumo wrestlers. Especially, an Ozeki sumo wrestler was reportedly threatened by a gangster. The gangster demanded hush money to the wrestler regarding his betting baseball games. Baseball gambles are conducted by gangsters. Therefore, they become their fund to act. To participate the gambles helps such antisocial groups. There are many other problems in the Sumo Association which are revealed in these days. I hope that it will regenerate.
